In the "database folder" there is a database named 'amul'.
In amul database you can find the details of my tables.
Now in "user folder" there are 4 files:
- style                 .css        //style file is for web page designing 
- login                 .php        //login user code
- user_registration     .php        //user register code
- welcome               .php        //when registration or login is done welcome.php file will run. For now I have just print "hi" as message in welcome.php file.
